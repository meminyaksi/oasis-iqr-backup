# @brief  Squeeze the last slack out of an ALREADY ROUTED design with extra post-route
#         phys_opt_design passes. Generalized from build-28's copy (which hardcoded that build).
#
# WHY THIS WORKS ON build-29 (and only bought +0.021 on build-28). phys_opt_design repairs timing
# LOCALLY on a routed design -- replicating high-fanout drivers so each copy sits near its loads,
# retiming registers across logic, re-placing individual critical cells, then re-routing just what
# it touched. Which repair pays depends on WHY the path is slow:
#   build-28 SpreadSLLs (-0.657): 15 levels, 47.8% LOGIC  -> logic-depth bound. Retiming led, and the
#                                 whole ladder only recovered +0.021 (CARRY8 chains already tight).
#   build-29 HBM-out    (-0.553):  7 levels, 84.3% ROUTE, cluster fanouts 52..234 -> DRIVER-TOO-FAR
#                                 bound. REPLICATION is the matching repair, so it leads here.
# Hence the directive order below is deliberately fanout/replication-first for this build.
#
# METHOD. Each attempt RE-OPENS the best checkpoint so far, applies ONE directive, and is kept only if
# it improves setup WITHOUT breaking hold. Re-opening is what makes a failed attempt free instead of
# destructive (phys_opt_design mutates the design in place).
#
# HOLD IS A REAL RISK: replication and retiming both trade setup for hold, and this design sits at
# WHS +0.004 ns. An attempt that improves WNS but drives WHS negative is REJECTED -- a hold violation
# is a broken bitstream, not a tradeoff.
#
# Usage:  export TERM=xterm
#         vivado -mode batch -source physopt_iterate.tcl                      # defaults below
#         vivado -mode batch -source physopt_iterate.tcl -tclargs "<DIRECTIVES>" <IN_DCP> <OUT_TAG>
