//   * parquet footer min/max -- present on every row group of every dataset here, but NOT robust:
//     taxi_d4 spans -128540..33407632, so 4096 bins are 8192 wide while the fares themselves live
//     in 0..5000. Every value lands in bin 0 => q1 == q3 => IQR 0 => degenerate fences.
//   * a percentile over the per-group footer min/max -- no better, because outliers are spread
//     across essentially every row group (taxi_d4 is 10 % outliers), so every group's max is extreme.
// What is actually needed is real values drawn from ACROSS the file. Reading the first DataChunk of
// a handful of uniformly-spaced row groups costs a few ms of host CPU, spans the column by
// construction, and feeds the same robust p1/p99 rule IqrRunner::derive_window already uses.

// WHY. DeriveWindowSpanning() pulls one DataChunk (2048 rows) from each of 16 spanning row groups on
// the HOST. That sounds cheap -- 0.05 % of sf10 -- but you cannot decode 2048 rows out of a
// compressed Parquet page: reading any row forces a full page decompress. So it costs ~3.2 ms per
// group, ~51 ms of host CPU, parallelised down to ~18 ms of wall clock. And every one of those pages
// is decompressed AGAIN by the FPGA moments later as part of the real decode. It is pure duplicated
// work, and it lands on the metric this study leads with: §9.15.1 measured host CPU-work on
// tpch_extprice falling 3.70x -> 1.91x once the window was enabled.
//
// So: decode the 16 spanning groups on the FPGA (fuse off, since the bins do not exist yet), sample
// their output, derive the window, and let the caller then decode the WHOLE column with the bins
// already set. The sampled groups therefore decode twice, ~3 ms of FPGA time. That is deliberate.
// The alternative -- keeping their decoded values and replaying them into the (idle) iqr_host_in
// port so nothing decodes twice -- saves ~1.7 ms but requires flipping fuse_enable in the middle of
// the HISTOGRAM state, i.e. a posted CSR write with no ordering against in-flight data. That is the
// same hazard class that already forced the histogram-clear fence, and it is not worth 1.7 ms.
//
// The sample must SPAN the column. Taking it from whichever groups decode first is the prefix window,
// which flagged 19,997,999 of 20,000,000 rows against a true answer of 200 (RESULTS.md 9.15).

// iqr_cpu_flags(path VARCHAR, column VARCHAR) -- the CPU reference implementation
//
// The apples-to-apples twin of iqr_flags_only: same bind, same validation, same packed-bitmask
// output, same emit code (EmitFlagSlice). The ONLY difference is that the quartiles and the fence
// comparison run on the host cores instead of on the FPGA.
//
// Why this exists. The CPU baseline used to be an ~9-line SQL query (6 CTEs, a GROUP BY, a window
// function, correlated subqueries). That measures "FPGA operator vs CPU algorithm + DuckDB's parser,
// binder, optimizer and general-purpose executor" -- not FPGA vs CPU. Our own phrasing sweep proved
// the point: the *same* algorithm written five different ways in SQL ranged 0.092 s to 3.381 s, a
// 37x spread. A SQL baseline therefore measures the query, not the machine. Implementing it here
// makes both sides one line of SQL and makes the baseline something a reviewer can actually read.
//
// The algorithm, matching the SQL exactly:
//   q1 = smallest v with (#elements <= v)*4 >= N  ==  the ceil(N/4)-th smallest value
//   q3 = smallest v with (#elements <= v)*4 >= 3N ==  the ceil(3N/4)-th smallest value
//   d = q3-q1;  lo = q1 - (d + (d>>1));  hi = q3 + (d + (d>>1))   (1.5*IQR, divider-free)
//   flag[i] = (v[i] < lo) || (v[i] > hi)
// so the quartiles are plain order statistics. We resolve them with an iterative histogram zoom
// rather than a sort: one parallel min/max pass, then parallel binned passes that narrow the range
// holding each rank one level at a time (both quartiles advanced in the SAME pass) until a bin holds
// a single distinct value, which is then exact. O(N) per level, at most a handful of levels (two for
// every dataset here), no sort, no candidate materialization, bounded memory -- and the same shape as
// the hardware's windowed histogram. See SelectQuartiles / AdvanceRankQueries below.

// OASIS_IQR_CPU_RAW_ALLOC=1 makes the CPU baseline allocate its materialised column with raw

// iqr_cpu_flags_groupby(path, column) -- the DIRECT C++ TRANSLITERATION of the SQL baseline
//
// Why this exists (RESULTS.md 9.29). `iqr_cpu_flags` shares the SQL's *rule* but not its *mechanics*:
// it resolves the quartiles with an iterative histogram zoom, which is a different algorithm that
// happens to produce the same answer. That conflates two effects in the SQL -> C++ speedup of 9.1:
//
//     (a) leaving DuckDB's parser / binder / optimizer / general-purpose executor
//     (b) replacing GROUP BY + ORDER BY with a histogram
//
// This function is (a) alone. It transliterates the SQL statement for statement:
//
//     ecnt AS (SELECT v, count(*) c FROM s GROUP BY v)          -> per-thread hash tables + combine
//     ecum AS (SELECT v, sum(c) OVER (ORDER BY v) cc FROM ecnt) -> sort the DISTINCT values, scan
//     eq   AS (min(v) WHERE cc*4>=t / cc*4>=3*t)                -> first hit in that scan
//     ef   AS (q1-(d+(d>>1)), q3+(d+(d>>1)))                    -> IqrFences, unchanged
//     SELECT (v < lo OR v > hi)                                 -> ComputeFlagMask, unchanged
//
// It deliberately shares ReadColumnCpu, IqrFences, ComputeFlagMask and the whole emit path with
// iqr_cpu_flags, so a head-to-head measures the quartile computation and nothing else.
//
// Shape note: this is a hash aggregate over N followed by a sort over D (the distinct count) -- the
// same shape DuckDB's plan has, and NOT a sort over N (that is 6.5's approach 4, 36.8x slower).
// Memory is therefore O(D) per thread; on these datasets D <= ~2 M, so the per-thread tables can
// reach a few tens of MB each. That is the same cost the SQL baseline pays.
// =============================================================================================

// Bottom-up parallel merge sort over the (value, count) pairs -- the `order` phase.
//
// This was a single-threaded std::sort and it is the dominant cost on high-cardinality columns:
// **83.64 ms of tpch_extprice's 126.14 ms operator (66 %)** at D = 933,900, and 121 ms on sf10 at
// D = 1.35 M (RESULTS.md 9.33). Low-cardinality columns are unaffected either way (tpch_qty's `order`
// is 0.02 ms at D = 50), which is why this is the fix for extprice/sf10 specifically.
//
// Bottom-up rather than a K-way merge: each round merges disjoint adjacent pairs of runs, so every
// round is embarrassingly parallel and needs no coordination. The final rounds have few pairs and so
// less parallelism -- that is inherent to merge sort and is why the expected speedup is ~5-6x, not 32x.
